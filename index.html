                Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. 
            <br>Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. 
            <br>However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime describes all animated works, 
            <br>regardless of style or origin. From 2000 to 2010, an average of 209 anime were produced 
            <br>per year and in the last decade; from 2010 to 2020, an average of 300 anime were produced per year
            <br>Yes, there was an increase of almost 100 anime produced per year in the last decade, 
            <br>but there is a concern in the past years about the production of anime.
